# Unhandled error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state') in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access component state before it's mounted.  The `Bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `BugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

Accessing `this.state` within the constructor or before the component renders leads to the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')". This happens because the state hasn't been initialized yet.

## Solution

The solution involves accessing the state only after the component has mounted or using lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` for initialization that depends on state.
